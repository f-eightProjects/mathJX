/**
 * The {@code geometry} package provides mathematical utility functions related to geometry.
 * <p>
 * It includes methods for computing area, perimeter, surface area, volume, distance between points,
 * and other common geometric calculations including the Pythagorean theorem.
 * <p>
 * This package is a part of the {@code mathJX} project and is designed to offer reusable
 * geometric computation logic for other modules within the project.
 * <p>
 * All methods in this package are stateless and utility-based.
